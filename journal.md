I am reflecting what I did semester didn't really do good and what I think I can improve on is for me to pay more attention and stop sleeping in class and be more productive and happy on what I did and i will do more this semestert and not fail.

I think the tik tok banned was kinda dumb becuase they said it was supposed to happen a few times and never did. They did banne dbut like it was for a couple of hours and brought it back and gave it an 90 days to sort out stuff but most likely to keep it and mt thought about technology and privacy is important and should be good and not happen but tik tok is a good app so i dont't care.
